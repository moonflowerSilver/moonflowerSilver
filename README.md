 Hello!


<p align="center">
You're probably here because you saw me in PonyTown and in that case, here's some information about me you wouldn't find on my strawpage.
I may seem dry at first but that's because it takes a bit of time for me to warm up to you, if I don't answer you, you can whisper me! I'm most likely offtab, doing something or on rivals in that case.
Please DNI if you're under 13.

<p align="center">
I sometimes call people dear and darling so if you're uncomfortable with it, please tell me.

I do not wish to roleplay as my ponies in PonyTown.
Please do not come up to me and attempt to roleplay, begin kissing me for no reason or trying to do a ship with me, I don't have anything against ships (as long as they are legal), I just don't want someone to try and roleplay with me and try to ship their pony with mine.

<p align="center">
If you're a selfshipper that treats cosplayers like they're the actual character (just in general, doesn't even have to be on PonyTown), then please DNI.
I don't have a problem with selfshipping in general, just those specific selfshippers.

I'm not sure if I kin any characters, so please don't ask. You're allowed to tell me that you think I act as a certain character, however.
<p align="center">
I really like adding Norse runes in the Elder Futhark script on things, specifically online. So feel free to decode the ones you find as they do mean something and isn't just gibberish.
