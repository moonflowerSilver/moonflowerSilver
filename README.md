In case you wish to friend me on Marvel Rivals, my username is 78_X

<p align="center">
 I do have Discord but I do not give it out to random people so if you wish to friend me on there, I'll have to know you for more than just an hour. My friend requests and DMs are off for my own safety (Discord only), so I'll initiate adding you on Discord once I'm comfortable.

I'm quite suspicious and distrustful of people and expect to be betrayed by anybody and everyone. My suspiciouns and distrustfulness is not due to you doing anything wrong, it's merely a trauma response. I can and will lie to you if it appeals to my interests or goals or if I just don't like you. I sometimes switch between grammar and casual texting randomly, this does not mean I'm angry at you or anything along those lines, I just like being dramatic.

<p align="center">
If your name is Scara, Alex, Koni, Levan or Mylo, please interact with caution. This is simply due to personal reasons and I have negative connotations with those names due to those personal reasons. Please don't mention anybody with those names if we know each other to/around me as I'll get suspicious and distrustful of you immediately.

You're probably here because you saw me in PonyTown and in that case, here's some more information about me.
I may seem dry at first but that's because it takes a bit of time for me to warm up to you, if I don't answer you, you can whisper me! I'm most likely offtab, doing something or on rivals in that case.
Please DNI if you're under 13 and interact with caution if you're 18+.

<p align="center">
I sometimes call people dear and darling so if you're uncomfortable with it, please tell me.

I do not wish to roleplay as my ponies in PonyTown.
Please do not come up to me and attempt to roleplay, begin kissing me for no reason or trying to do a ship with me, I don't have anything against ships (as long as they are legal), I just don't want someone to try and roleplay with me and try to ship their pony with mine.

<p align="center">
If you're a selfshipper that treats cosplayers like they're the actual character (just in general, doesn't even have to be on PonyTown), then please DNI.
I don't have a problem with selfshipping in general, just those specific selfshippers. If you selfship yourself with Loki, interact with caution as I can get uncomfortable.

I kin Loki but you're allowed to tell me that you think I act as other certain characters, however. Due to this, I view comments and such made about Loki as comments made about me and sometimes refer to Loki as me and call myself the God of Mischief. I do not have anything against doubles, but I do enjoy being the only Loki in someone's friend list so if you're friends with any of my friends and a double, interact with caution.

I enjoy adding Norse runes in the Elder Futhark script on things, specifically online. So feel free to decode the ones you find as they do mean something and isn't just gibberish.
